## ABOUT

This is a visual collage of "All Watched Over By Machines Of Loving Grace" by Richard Brautigan. I created three different environments for each stanza of the poem where each space subsequently loses machines as "we join back to nature."

The third environment background is a direct scene from the ending of Princess Mononoke, where there is a rebirth of nature from heavy urbanization from humans â€“ sadly not from technology, but from coal. Nevertheless, I thought this scene was still a good representation of where we return to nature.

## INSPIRATION

I heavily drew inspiration from Faith Holland's [Digital Garden](https://www.faithholland.com/) and her use of collage and gifs to create this project. I also used various scenes from Studio Ghibli including Howl's Moving Castle and Princess Mononoke.
